# Deermood Project

This is my first big learning project. An active website for a made-up company called Deermood that specializes in organic, plastic-free clothing. Below, I list the most important information about what I used to create this project.

### Technologies i used

To build the page and its whole logic I used HTML, vanilla CSS as well as vanilla JS, thne just merged everything with Git... thats all.

### Images and Icons source

All the images I used were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) using their free plan. SVGs on the other hand, were taken from [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/).

### Other handy apps

Other app that came in handy in my work:

- [Cooloors](https://coolors.co/) - for finding color pallete's that suits the site most and checking contrasts

- [Dopley Colors](https://colors.dopely.top/) - mostly for generating tints and shades

- [iLoveIMG](https://www.iloveimg.com/) - for resizing images

### Inspiration

Here are a few sites I draw inspiration from:

- [tentree](https://www.tentree.com/) - Most of the ideas from here.

- [Amour Vert](https://amourvert.com/)
